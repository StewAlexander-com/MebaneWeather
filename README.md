## 🌟 What Makes This Special

### 🎯 **Hyper-Local Accuracy**
- **Geographic Precision**: Uses exact Mebane, NC coordinates for SPC threat detection
- **Official Sources**: Integrates directly with NOAA/SPC MapServer APIs and NWS alert systems
- **Real-time Updates**: Continuously monitors changing weather conditions with dual polling intervals
- **Smart Alert Filtering**: Zone-specific alerts (NCZ023) with statewide fallback

### 🛡️ **Smart Threat Assessment**
The dashboard uses a sophisticated four-tier threat classification system with priority-based evaluation:

| Threat Level | Icon | Color | Description | Trigger Conditions |
|--------------|------|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| **SAFE** | ✅ | 🟢 Green | No severe weather expected | No active warnings and no SPC risk |
| **MONITOR** | □ | 🟡 Yellow | Monitor conditions for potential development | SPC Marginal (MRGL) or Slight (SLGT) risk |
| **CAUTION** | ⚡ | 🟠 Orange | Elevated severe weather risk - stay alert | SPC Enhanced (ENH), Moderate (MDT), or High (HIGH) risk |
| **WARNING** | ⚠️ | 🔴 Red | Active weather warnings in effect - follow official guidance | Active NWS warnings in Alamance County |

**Priority Hierarchy**: Active warnings (WARNING) override all other indicators, followed by elevated SPC risks (CAUTION), then lower SPC risks (MONITOR), and finally safe conditions (SAFE).

### 📊 **SPC Risk Categories**
Displays all official Storm Prediction Center threat levels with detailed descriptions:

- 🌩️ **TSTM**: General Thunderstorms, No Severe Weather Expected
- 🟡 **MRGL**: Marginal Risk - Isolated severe storms possible
- 🟠 **SLGT**: Slight Risk - Scattered severe storms likely
- 🔴 **ENH**: Enhanced Risk - Numerous severe storms expected
- 🔴 **MDT**: Moderate Risk - Widespread severe storms likely
- ⚫ **HIGH**: High Risk - Major severe weather outbreak expected

### 📝 **Intelligent Forecast Discussion Summarization**
The dashboard uses an advanced scoring algorithm to extract the most relevant information from NWS Area Forecast Discussions (AFD). It:

- Scores sentences based on hazard keywords, severity indicators, and timeframe relevance
- Filters out boilerplate text, navigation elements, and non-weather content
- Displays the top 3 most relevant sentences about severe weather hazards
- Provides quick access to the full AFD via clickable panel

/**
 * Geographic coordinates for [Your Location]
 * Used for SPC outlook spatial queries
 */
const coords = { lat: 36.096, lng: -79.267 }; // Mebane, NC
```

**Important**: Also update the NWS zone code in the alert function:

```javascript
// Primary: zone-specific alerts for [YOUR_ZONE]
data = await fetchJSON('https://api.weather.gov/alerts/active?zone=YOUR_ZONE', 8000);
```

### ⏱️ **Update Frequency**

Adjust the refresh intervals as needed:

```javascript
// Full dashboard refresh interval (default: 15 minutes)
const updateInterval = 900000; // milliseconds

// Fast alert polling interval (default: 3 minutes)
setInterval(async function() {
  // Alert check logic
}, 180000); // milliseconds
```

### 🎨 **Visual Customization**

The dashboard uses inline CSS for easy customization:

- **Background Colors**: 
  - Main container: `#1a1a1a`
  - Panels: `#2d2d2d`
  - Sections: `#373737`
  
- **Accent Colors**: 
  - Primary (threat panel): `#4fc3f7`

  - Header gradient: Purple (`#8a6df2` to `#5a0fbf`)

### 🔧 **Advanced Configuration**

#### Alert Filtering
Modify the alert filtering logic to change which alerts are displayed:

```javascript
// Current: Shows warnings, watches, advisories with severe/moderate/minor severity
// Modify the filter conditions in updateLocalAlertsAndGetStatus()
```

#### AFD Summarization
Adjust the scoring algorithm in `updateForecastDiscussion()`:
- Modify `hazardSets` to add/remove hazard categories
- Adjust scoring weights in `scoreSentence()` function
- Change the number of displayed sentences (currently top 3)

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### ⚠️ **Common Issues**

#### "SPC: Data temporarily unavailable"
- **Cause**: API endpoint temporarily down or network timeout
- **Solution**: Wait 15 minutes for automatic retry, check browser console for specific errors
- **Note**: Dashboard will default to SAFE status if SPC data unavailable

#### "Loading threat assessment..." persists
- **Cause**: JavaScript initialization failure or DOM not ready
- **Solution**: 
  1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
  2. Ensure code is properly embedded (no HTML corruption)
  3. Verify no conflicting JavaScript on page
  4. Check browser compatibility (requires modern browser)

#### Dashboard not responsive on mobile
- **Cause**: Weebly or platform CSS conflicts
- **Solution**: Code includes `!important` declarations to override platform styles. If issues persist, check responsive breakpoints in CSS section.

#### Alerts not updating quickly
- **Cause**: Alert polling interval may need adjustment
- **Solution**: Fast alert polling runs every 3 minutes. If warnings should appear faster, reduce the 180000ms interval (but be mindful of API rate limits).

#### Forecast Discussion shows "No significant weather"
- **Cause**: AFD text processing may be filtering out relevant content, or API unavailable
- **Solution**: Check browser console for AFD fetch errors. The scoring algorithm requires specific keywords - verify AFD contains relevant severe weather terminology.

### 🐛 **Debug Mode**

Enable debug logging by opening browser Developer Tools (F12) and checking the Console tab. The dashboard logs:

- SPC risk level detection results
- API response status codes
- Alert processing results
- Update cycle timing information
- Error messages with context

### 🔍 **Verifying Functionality**

1. **Check Data Sources**:
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Look for fetch requests to:
     - `mapservices.weather.noaa.gov` (SPC data)
     - `api.weather.gov` (alerts)
     - `forecast.weather.gov` (AFD)

2. **Test Alert Updates**:
   - Monitor console during active weather
   - Should see alert status changes logged
   - Threat level should update within 3 minutes of new warnings

3. **Verify Threat Calculation**:
   - Check SPC outlook for your area: https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/
   - Compare dashboard threat level with SPC risk level
   - Warnings should override SPC risks
